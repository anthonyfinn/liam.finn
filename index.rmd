# Hi, I'm Liam Finn.
</center>

I am recent graduate of UCSB, where I studied Geography/GIS. I was born and raised in Redwood City, CA. Most recently, I worked at Intuitive Surgical in Santa Clara, CA. I worked as a 3D printing technician in the machine shop, where I assisted in creating, designing, and starting 3D print builds. Currently, I am working to improve and develop my GIS analyst/coding skills.

I am interested in pursuing a career that involves additive manufacturing or 3D modeling. I have experience in 3D printing, and I hope to combine this with what I've recently studied; Geography/GIS/Geoinformatics. This includes data visualization, modeling, as well as terrain and surface analysis. I have worked with vector, raster, and tabular data in a coding environment (R). Whether as a GIS Analyst or Technician, I will use my education and work experience to make practical sense of processed data and apply it to a real world application (such as Civil Engineering)
